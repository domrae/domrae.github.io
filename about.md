We first met somewhere in the middle of the Baltic Sea between Stockholm and Tallinn and exchanged conversations daily during our stay in Europe back in 2013. We are two very different people thankfully brought together by a twist of fate.

Both of us crave for days where we can get a chance to just slip into a hammock undisturbed at sunset with an ice cold beer and a slow sway to the tunes of our favourite song.
