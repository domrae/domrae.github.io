We took Airasia for our flight to Yogyakarta. There was an hour delay during departure.. ðŸ˜’

We arrived at the hotel ([Hotel NEO Malioboro](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g294230-d8092831-Reviews-Hotel_Neo_Malioboro-Yogyakarta_Java.html)) sometime after lunch. It was pretty nice and well equipped for a 3 star hotel.

## Prambanan Temple

Headed out to [Prambanan Temple](http://wikitravel.org/en/Prambanan) later on in the day. It's around 20-30mins by taxi out of Jogja. We took a cab charging by the meter to avoid being ripped off, but alas we were driven around in circles before being brought out to the temple ðŸ˜‘. Unfortunately, it was but a foreshadowing of the rest of our trip dealing with transport.

Unfortunately the weather was rather gloomy so it was quite the downer for the trip. The shrines were magnificient though! Entry to the temple was **SGD$22** which was kinda steep, but it was put towards maintenance of the premises.

We took the same taxi back after arranging for a return fee with the driver (who conveniently misunderstood the arranged fee and charged more but oh well). Tired and hungry we decided to eat at a hostel near our hotel. LOL, the food was absolutely terrible but the hostel had good tours (described fully in a booklet with prices listed), which we booked for the rest of the trip. 

[Bedhot Resto Hostel/Restaurant](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurant_Review-g294230-d3148632-Reviews-Bedhot_Resto-Yogyakarta_Java.html)

Trips we took with them:

- Borobudur Sunrise Tour
- Mt Merapi Jeep Tour
- Yogyakarta - Mt. Bromo (Cemoro Lawang) transport

Highly recommended, but stay away from the food lmao it was trash

![looks good but taste.....ehh](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2833/34213718945_7e9a17b3a6_k_d.jpg)

Due to the timezone difference (1 hour behind us), sunrise and sunset timings there were around an hour earlier than we were used to.

Heading out to Borobudur tomorrow morning, so early night for us!
