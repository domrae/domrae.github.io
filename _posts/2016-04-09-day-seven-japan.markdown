Had our last lunch at [Uogashi Nihon-Ichi], a standing sushi bar in Shibuya. We select the sushi and the chef places it on a leaf infront of us. Jap sushi def on a diff lvl from Singapore. Tried some rare-r flavours like crab innards, slightly broiled squid legs with mayo, boiled conger and ship roll with boiled manila clam amongst others. Yumz :> 10 pieces of sushi each, with such quality at only sgd$12, its a steal~

We couldnt find coin lockers for our luggage so we were damn burdened and just settled for a last coffee at Kinokuniya nearby before heading to the airport (T_T).

Some photos of [our accomm at Shibuya]:

Location - 5 mins walk from the airport limousine bus stop and about 10 minutes walk to Shibuya station. Very quiet area where the locals stay, with 7-11 & family mart all nearby!

Room was great for the two of us, not sure if good/bad that both of us have similar messy habits lol. We only had a neat room on our last night when we were packing hahha.

The 2 down sides would probably be that the owner didnt provide us with magic clean sheets and our floor was (kinda) dusty towards the last few days - me & my clean floor OCD AND the toilet was tiny (assuming its the same everywhere in Tokyo). It was like a toilet in a cabin, but aiya functional~

Already looking forward to the next getaway with each other â™¡
