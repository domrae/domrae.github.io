Had our last lunch at [Uogashi Nihon-Ichi], a standing sushi bar in Shibuya. We select the sushi and the chef places it on a leaf infront of us. Jap sushi def on a diff lvl from Singapore. Tried some rare-r flavours like crab innards, slightly broiled squid legs with mayo, boiled conger and ship roll with boiled manila clam amongst others. Yumz :> 10 pieces of sushi each, with such quality at only sgd$12, its a steal~

We couldnt find coin lockers for our luggage so we were damn burdened and just settled for a last coffee at Kinokuniya nearby before heading to the airport (T_T).

Some photos of [our accomm at Shibuya]:

Location - 5 mins walk from the airport limousine bus stop and about 10 minutes walk to Shibuya station. Very quiet area where the locals stay, with 7-11 & family mart all nearby!

Equipment - bed able to fit up to 3 pax comfortably, iron & ironing board, free use of coffee maker, wifi egg provided, had around 20 jap movies dvd and projector for viewing on the wall infront of bed (sadly VGA cable not provided to link to computer).

Room was great for the two of us, not sure if good/bad that both of us have similar messy habits lol. We only had a neat room on our last night when we were packing hahha.

The 2 down sides would probably be that the owner didnt provide us with magic clean sheets and our floor was (kinda) dusty towards the last few days - me & my clean floor OCD AND the toilet was tiny (assuming its the same everywhere in Tokyo). It was like a toilet in a cabin, but aiya functional~

Already looking forward to the next getaway with each other â™¡
