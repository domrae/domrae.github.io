You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?

#### What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.

No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Red Five standing by.

1. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.
2. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
3. What?!

#### I call it luck.

I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Red Five standing by. Don't underestimate the Force. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
