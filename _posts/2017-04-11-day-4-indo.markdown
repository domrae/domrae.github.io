8.30am-9pm minibus journey from Yogyakarta to Cafe Lava hostel, crazy long ride but was comfy enough cause 3 pax in 12 pax bus. Journey cost us ~$20 for a direct trip right from our lobby so why not?

Cause we reached around 9, quickly went to the nearest resto to have dinner & went back to rest early for next day's climb. It was so coooooold in our room we slept with socks & jackets haha but not complaining, love cold weather!
