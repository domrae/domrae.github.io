Spent the ENTIRE DAY (8.30am-9pm) melting our butts on a minibus journey from Yogyakarta to our accommodation for Mt. Bromo in Cemoro Lawang (Cafe Lava Hostel), it was a crazy long ride but was comfy enough cause 3 pax in 12 pax bus. Journey cost us ~$20 for a direct trip right from our lobby so why not?

T'was an uneventful day doing nothing on the bus, so not much pictures today. The other guy on the bus (which we eventually found out to be a prc guy) didn't really talk to us (prolly cos he was shy) so it was kinda like a private car.

There was no aircon for the first half of the trip (driver being budget) so it was hot and stuffy. ughhh ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜ ðŸ”¥

The driver could hold his pee amazingly well and we only made one stop for lunch and toilet (while Dom was dying from holding in after gorging on drinks and snacks). Had lunch in this dinghy restaurant which served as a pit stop for cross country trips. Food was decent-ish~

We finally arrived at Cemoro Lawang at 9am, and the hostel's cafe was closed so we quickly headed down the street to the nearest resto to have dinner & went back to rest early for next day's climb. Food was simple but good (probably cause we were really hungry).

There was a é‡ŽçŒ« giving us pitiful eyes and meowing while we were having dinner, but we resisted feeding it as we didn't know if the owners were okay with it. After we stood up the cat immediately jumped onto the table and ate our leftovers while the owners watched on with indifference. lol

The hostel was way up on the mountain, so it was so coooooold in our room we slept with socks & jackets haha. Not complaining, love cold weather!
