On our way out we found a street nearby our apartment lined with cherry blossoms.

It looked really nice despite the weather!

Started the day with lunch at Ichiran ramen, yums. Combed and braved the crowds at Harujuku, it was C-R-A-Z-Y packed. There is the atas brands vs the street styles for teenagers. Loved the smaller streets which had more unique boutique shops :> Crepes everywhere. Decided to enter a neoprint shop and have our photo taken but boy, the editting software is TOO much for a boy wahahahahhaha. It was.... rather disturbing.

Hurried off to Shinjuku Gyoen to catch the cherry blossoms & have our hanami party with sakura asahi beer but...... we only had 40 mins till the park closes (why does it close so early???) & they did not allow alcohol (k la, this one understand cause family area). You guessed it, spent the whole time snapping away. Really love picnics, if only SG had 10 deg weathers, I'll drag dom to picnic every weekend hahhaha.

After that, we went to a camera shop (Map Camera) where Dom was blown away by all the lens and Leica cameras. I just.....stood at one side.... hahhaha. We walked so much today that Dom's fitband was 100% achievement for the first time lol. Headed back after Tonkatsu dinner to fill up our tummmmmmmies.

Crazy tired from walking the whole day but we're looking forward to tomorrow!
