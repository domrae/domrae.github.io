After 7 hours of flight, 30mins clearing immigration and 1 hour bus journey to Shibuya, 5 min walk to our place, we were so exhausted when we reached our room! It was 10 deg in the city which we totally love :) definitely choose 10 deg over the hazy 35 deg in sg.

We headed out to grab some dinner and stroll around Shibuya. Since it was Saturday, Shibuya was filled with streams of human traffic everywhere. Saw the prized Shibuya crossing, took our fair share of photos and time lapses. Decided to pop into the Yoshinoya around the corner. Tasted pretty much the same but the Tokyo ver had soy sauce green onions and a raw egg. The combi tasted good and we wondered why sg did not serve it the same way. Maybe cause raw egg not safe?

Continued blind walking around the area occasionally popping into different shops. We saw the police taking a fingerprint sample at a photobooth which was quite exciting, other than that nothing much and we called it a night :)
