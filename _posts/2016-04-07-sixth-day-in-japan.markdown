Started the day with ramen lunch at [Fu-Unji]. It was a different type of soup with thick layered flavours of rich chicken broth, smoky fish powder, chunks of tender pork, soft bamboo shoots and a ajitama egg. Noodles were springy and good. I was sure that it tasted something like a mee soto/mee rebus lololol. Half way through you HAVE to add water as the flavours become too strong.

After that we spent the day combing thru Ikebukuro. I made a new pair of specs at owndays as it was < $100sgd haha have been wanting a new pair for quite long. Dom made lens for his extra pair of specs (Y).

Was excited to visit the [Pokemon megastore] nearby but we were disappointed that the store was so-not-mega.

Headed to [Aoyama Flower Market & Cafe] after Ikebukuro. It was a chio cafe - wished we had more time to chill there~~

Rushed off to pamper ourselves with 10,000 yen (~$121) Matsusaka Beef Sirloin Steak ([Steak House Satou]). I thought it was really funny when the chef walked out with the beef so that we could snap photos with it and see the marbling before he cooked it. Definitely a must try for steak lovers man. However, it has a high fat to meat ratio so...may taste a bit fatty after a few mouths. BUT the juice & meat texture was AMAZING YUM. Served with a big portion of taogay.

Made our last stop the [local supermarket] at Shinagawa station. Did some grocery shopping~ but I realised that most snacks can also be found in sg! Was expecting more cute stuff.
