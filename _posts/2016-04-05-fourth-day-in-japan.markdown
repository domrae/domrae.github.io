Caught an early morning train to Hakone. Slept easily throughout the train. When we reached, it was insanely cold at 9 deg as both of us (mostly me) was dressed for 15 deg. It was a cold drizzly misty morning, with Mt Fuji not even in sight...but we will be back.

Both of us loved the baked honey cheese tart store! It was like a cheesecake on a tart base. Those sg neighbourhood bakeries wanna copy but not same texture eh, why?

Had to stop by a fishing shop to get hot packs cause it was too cold.

Found Hakone's Floating Tori of Peace.

Lunch Katsudon at this small homely restaurant near the train station, which like everything else in Hakone, was massively overpriced. -_-

At least it was nice~

After braving the cold with frozen noses, hands and toes, we went to seek some warmth at a nearby onsen. It wasnt as bad as I thought, maybe cause I'm alone and dont care about what other people think hahahah just walked in freely didnt even feel weird. It wasnt even that awkward facing other people's naked truth lol. Dom said the guys were more conservative.

(no pictures lol cameras not allowed)

Half way through there was a lady who called us into the Sauna room. She poured water to make the charcoal hot and used her red fan to spread the heat around the room. Then she waved the fan 3 times at every individual in the room. By this time, I was dying of heat, you guys know how much I perspire in SG right.....I was wishing that it was the end but NOOOOO she did everything AGAIN. Rejected her 3 waves of the fan for the second time, my body cannot take it man dno how the other people tahan. 

When I was done, I had natural blush for 30 mins lol. Actually going in with a friend, although awkward at naked bodies, is better cause can chit chat.

Didnt do much in Hakone cause of the bad weather but it was a really relaxing day after all the walking in central Toyko :)

Tried the famous Hakone black roasted egg. Similar to tea egg but had a lil burnt outer taste.

Settled for yakitori dinner at Toritake (hole in the wall yakitori bar at Shibuya) and tried Shochu, a jap spirit, I think I can live my life without alcohol man - ewwwwwww. Gave all to alcoholic Dom heh.

The restaurant was the most 'traditional' one we visited so far, having had our meal sitting cross-legged on tatami mats. It was interesting for the first 10 minutes until our legs cramped up..

Had some trouble ordering but some guy from the group next door helped us with the language barrier which was nice
