Made reservations to wear the Kimono so we grabbed our daily 7-11 fix and headed over.

Was surprised that she took so little time to dress me up! Went to a nearby salon which they partnered with to do up my hair. Chose a braidy curved design rather than the boring bun! LOVED the outcome. So surprised that she could tie up my shoulder length hair (with help of prob 20 pins)! So worth my money :))

Made our way to Sensoji temple to shake out our fortune. What is it called?? Hahahah. Both of us managed to get good fortune slips which mirrors and says that 'building a new house is good' and 'marriage and employment are all good'. Cheap thrill indeed. Prob all the good fortune slips say that lol.

Felt like celebrities when other tourists wanted to take photos with/of us.

Had a different kind of tempura for lunch. Wished it was a bit more crispy but different is good cause cant get it in sg :)

Managed to convince Dom to travel 4 stops to Ueno Park to have our last hanami session since we paid quite a bit for the kimono rental hehehe. Spammed photos till we didnt know what pose to do. 

Cherry blossoms really make the park damn chio la. But the dropping of the leaves damn ugly, esp when people step and all the petals become wet wet and black. Hah.

Went to do last minute shopping for parent gifts and queued 30min for Tokyo's top 3 ramen at Menya Itto. Its tsukumen (cold noodle & broth dip, reason for this is to maintain the aldente texture of the noodle) with 3 types of char siew is DAMN worth it at 1,100 yen. But portion def too much for a girl.

We spent so much money on the mrt for this trip. But it is very convenient :) Definitely still tons to explore in here, have to come back some other time!

So sad to part with the weather and carefree-ness!!
