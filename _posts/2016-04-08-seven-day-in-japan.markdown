Made reservations to wear the Kimono so we grabbed our daily 7-11 fix and headed over. Had this sausage almost every morning haha, love the packaging of the sauce. You break it into half and squeeze it, both sauces come out at the same time.

Was surprised that she took so little time to dress me up! Went to a nearby salon which they partnered with to do up my hair. Chose a braidy curved design rather than the boring bun! LOVED the outcome. So surprised that she could tie up my shoulder length hair (with help of prob 20 pins)! So worth my money :))

Made our way to [Sensoji temple] to shake out our fortune. What is it called?? Hahahah. Both of us managed to get good fortune slips which mirrors and says that 'building a new house is good' and 'marriage and employment are all good'. Cheap thrill indeed. Prob all the good fortune slips say that lol.

Felt like celebrities when other tourists wanted to take photos with/of us.

Managed to convince Dom to travel 4 stops to [Ueno Park] to have our last hanami session since we paid quite a bit for the kimono rental hehehe. Spammed photos till we didnt know what pose to do.

Cherry blossoms really make the park damn chio la. But the dropping of the leaves damn ugly, motion like dreamy sakura snow but when people step and all the petals become wet wet and black very yux.

p.s. the store had limited choices so Dom ended up looking frumpy and monk-ish as the yukata made his tummy look big as well lololz. the other guys we saw at Sensoji wear wearing an extra jacket which made them look cooler hah. next time (if there is ever), we know what to request for. -_-

Went to do last minute shopping for parent gifts and queued 30min for Tokyo's top 3 ramen at [Menya Itto]. Its tsukumen (cold noodle & broth dip, reason for this is to maintain the aldente texture of the noodle) with 3 types of char siew is DAMN worth it at 1,100 yen. But portion def too much for a girl.

We spent so much money on the mrt for this trip. But it is very convenient :) Definitely still tons to explore in here, have to come back some other time!
