Got up for an early morning 'hike' at Mount Takao. It was a 45 min ride away from central Tokyo - rather near. Weather was good, not flooded with crowds as well.

On the way up we tried Takao's famous dango. It tasted like a ball of flour with the Tori q sauce. Pretty nice to chew on with the cool air.

Took a chair lift up half the way as we didnt want to wear ourselves out. Totally did not regret that decision hahah. Many jap families + aunties & uncles were resting at the top of the mountain. Ourselves, we were chomping on all the unhealthy 7-11 snacks we stocked up on (guilty smile). It was scenic and a good change away from bustling Tokyo.

We walked the whole way down. Boy it was many steep slopes, this was when we knew paying 490 yen for the chair lift was worth it hahahahha. Anyway fyi - the hike is only 4.1~km!

Headed to Akihabara & tried the famous Pablo Cheese Tart! It was yummy but both of us felt that the Hakone Honey Cheese Tart was still the best tasting tart so far!

We managed to book a slot to the Owl cafe and it was a good experience as we never knew we would ever stroke/hold owls! Dom was excited while I was a bit hesitant as I was intimidated by the owls' gaze lol. Only can manage the mini owls heh. The biggest owl in the shop was almost the size of a cat? Huge!

Continued on with a bit of electronics viewing for the boy & dinner at Mawaru Ganso Sushi, a conveyor belt sushi place which was yummy. Ate about 16 pieces of sushi, was SO full of carbs. Walked a bit and headed back to rest our feet :>
